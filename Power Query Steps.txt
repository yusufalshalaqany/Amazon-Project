Project Steps
	• Explore & Cleaning Using Power Query Tool (Data Integration)
Rename All Columns & Explore Errors
coupon_text  Coupon Applied (Replace blank with No Coupon)
Replace any true/false with 0 and 1 to make it easy to count by changing type to whole number
product_availability  Product Availability (replace blank with Unknown)
is_prime  Amazon Prime
is_amazon_choice  Amazon Choice
unit_price & unit_count are deleted due to 99% nulls (no data)
delivery is deleted due to no importance for analysis
has_variations  Product Variations
climate_pledge_friendly  Climate Friendly Products
sales_volume  Sales Volume
Replace (blank, List:, More Buying Choices, Typical:, Typical price:, other) with 0
Replace K with 000
Change type to whole number

Delete 4 Rows (B0CMDLJR6K, B07ZHPCJW3, B07Z6Q9NCZ & B09R6FJWWS) 
Due to null values in 5 columns reduce from 340 to 336 rows

Merge Original Price with Product Price 
Null values in original price means Original Price = Product Price (no change in price)
Using  New Custom Column = [Original Price] ?? [Product Price]
To keep all Original Price values and merge only null with Product Price

Star Rating (replace null value with mean 4.0) 
I calculated median and I found 4.1, by quick looking at numbers of null values, its only 3 null values, so, no strong gap between 4.0 & 4.1
Select all columns and remove duplicates (from 336 to 315 row)

Clean Product Name by replacing wrong values

Hint: ASIN = Amazon Standard Identification Number
